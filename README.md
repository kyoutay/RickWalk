# Privacy Policy
To not be verbose, I don't store, monitor, or do anything 
with your data. Any data being dealt with within the app is 
volatile. Basically meaning that swiping out of the app will
 delete any data that was dealt with during the app run. To keep 
your mind more at peace, if you haven't
 already done so when first opening the app, you can 
change the location permission to "only while using the app".
