Not Rickroll, but Rickwalk. An app that tracks your distance traveled 
in terms of various things, including Rick Astley. Utilizes the 
Haversine formula.
Download on the google playstore: 

# Privacy Policy
To not be verbose, I don't store, monitor, or do anything 
with your data. Any data being dealt with within the app is 
volatile. Basically meaning that swiping out of the app will
 delete any data that was dealt with during the app run. To keep 
your mind more at peace, if you haven't
 already done so when first opening the app, you can 
change the location permission to "only while using the app".

# Some Additional Info
Any "weirdness" in the distance counter could be attributed to the limited 0-10m accuracy.
I am cool so star this repo.
